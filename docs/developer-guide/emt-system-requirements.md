# System Requirements

<!--
Content Requirements:
1. Provide minimum and recommended hardware specs.
2. List supported software environments or dependencies.
3. Ensure clarity for different installation environments (e.g., virtual machines, embedded systems).
-->

The hardware and software requirements outlined here apply to Edge Microvisor Toolkit itself.
Specific requirements will mostly depend on the type of deployment (container, VM,
K8s workload) and the type and number of workloads deployed on a node. When choosing the
hardware device, microvisor image, and the workload packaging method, consider the
requirements & KPIs of the intended applications/workloads, to ensure that sufficient
residual compute capability is available.

## Hardware Requirements
