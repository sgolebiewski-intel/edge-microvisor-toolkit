# Build Edge Microvisor Toolkit and Deploy on Edge Nodes

This guide will walk you through the entire process of Edge Microvisor Toolkit deployment.
You will learn how to build the toolkit, install it on a single or multiple edge node
clusters, and deploy AI solutions.

The Edge Microvisor Toolkit Standalone Node supports different EMT images to
meet specific edge deployment needs. You can choose from:

- **Edge Microvisor Toolkit Non Realtime image** (default)
- **Edge Microvisor Toolkit Desktop Virtualization image**
- **Custom immutable Edge Microvisor Toolkit created using** [Build Instructions](#1-build-the-microvisor)

## 1. Build the microvisor

If you want to create your own custom standalone node, follow the instructions below to build
the microvisor from scratch. If you wish to use the default, non-real-time image of Edge Microvisor
skip to [Create a bootable USB installer](#create-a-bootable-usb-installer).

1. Clone the stable branch of edge-microvisor-toolkit repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-microvisor-toolkit --branch=3.0.20250718
   ```

2. Navigate to the `edge-microvisor-toolkit` directory:

   ```bash
   cd edge-microvisor-toolkit
   ```

3. Install prerequisites:

   Requirements for building the toolchain were validated on an Ubuntu 22.04 host.

   ```bash
   # Install required dependencies.
   sudo ./toolkit/docs/building/prerequisites-ubuntu.sh

   # Also supported is:
   #    make -C toolkit install-prereqs

   # Fix go 1.21 link
   sudo ln -vsf /usr/lib/go-1.21/bin/go /usr/bin/go
   sudo ln -vsf /usr/lib/go-1.21/bin/gofmt /usr/bin/gofmt

   # Install and configure Docker.
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
   sudo sh get-docker.sh
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

   **You will need to log out and log back in** for user changes to take effect.

4. Navigate to the `toolkit` subdirectory.

   ```bash
   cd ./toolkit
   ```

5. Build the toolchain.

   ```bash
   sudo make toolchain REBUILD_TOOLS=y
   ```

6. Customize the toolkit image.

   You can include additional components to your toolkit image by adding RPM packages.
   For more details, read
   [Customize Your Edge Microvisor Toolkit Image](./emt-building-howto.md#customize-your-edge-microvisor-toolkit-image).

7. Build the toolkit image:

   All available image configurations are stored in JSON files, located in the `imageconfigs` folder.
   For example, to build a RAW image without real-time extensions, use `edge-image.json` and run
   the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo make image -j8 REBUILD_TOOLS=y REBUILD_PACKAGES=n CONFIG_FILE=./imageconfigs/edge-image.json
   ```

   For more information about specific building parameters, refer to the [article.](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-microvisor-toolkit/blob/3.0/toolkit/docs/building/building.md#local-build-variables).

## 2. Create a bootable USB installer

### Prepare the bootable USB drive

   Ensure the correct USB drive is selected to avoid data loss.
   Replace `/dev/sdX` with the device name of your USB drive.

   - Insert the USB drive and identify the USB disk:

      ```bash
      lsblk -o NAME,MAJ:MIN,RM,SIZE,RO,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT,MODEL
      ```

   - Use the `wipefs` command to remove any existing filesystem signatures from the USB drive.
     This ensures a clean slate for formatting

      ```bash
      sudo wipefs --all --force /dev/sdX
      ```

   - Format the USB drive with the FAT32 filesystem, using `mkfs.vfat`:

      ```bash
      sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdX
      ```

   - Unmount the USB drive to ensure the creation of bootable USB.

     - Check what is currently mounted:

       ```bash
       df -hT
       ```

     - Unmount the drive:

       ```bash
       sudo umount /dev/sdX
       ```

### Prepare the installation files

1. Clone the edge-microvisor-toolkit-standalone-node repository:

   ```bash
   cd
   git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-microvisor-toolkit-standalone-node
   ```

2. Navigate to the `edge-microvisor-toolkit-standalone-node` directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../../edge-microvisor-toolkit-standalone-node
   ```

3. Create the installer:

   To create the installation tar file with all required components for preparing a bootable USB
   drive, run the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo make build
   ```

   > **Note:** This command will generate the `standalone-installation-files.tar.gz` file.
     The file will be located in the `./standalone-node/installation-scripts/out` directory.


4. Copy the contents of `standalone-installation-files.tar.gz`:

   Since the `./standalone-node/installation-scripts/out` folder is read only, you need to
   select a folder to which you will extract the required files and then edit them.
   For example, you can create the `standalone-installation-files` folder in the
   `\home` directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~\standalone-installation-files
   ```

   Extract the contents to the selected folder:

   ```bash
   tar -xzf ./standalone-node/installation_scripts/out/standalone-installation-files.tar.gz -C ~/standalone-installation-files
   ```

   The extracted files are as follows:

   ```text
   bootable-usb-prepare.sh
   write-image-to-usb.sh
   config-file
   usb-bootable-files.tar.gz
   edgenode-logs-collection.sh
   standalone-vm-setup.sh
   download_images.sh
   user-apps
   ```

   Navigate to the folder with the extracted installation files:

   ```bash
   cd ~/standalone-installation-files
   ```

   Download the Kubernetes artifacts (container images and manifest files) by
   executing the `./download_images.sh` script. For the default non-teal-time image,
   use the `NON-RT` parameter.

   ```bash
   sudo ./download_images.sh NON-RT
   ```

   > **Note:** By default, the script will only pull basic kubernetes artifacts to create a
     single node cluster. If you want to use EMT image with desktop virtualization features,
     use the `DV` parameter instead of `NON-RT`.

   Update the `config-file` with your deployment-specific settings.
   This configuration file is used to provision the edge node during
   its initial boot and should include the following parameters:

   - **Proxy settings** - when the edge node requires a proxy to access external networks.
   - **SSH key** - the public SSH key (typically your `id_rsa.pub`) from your Linux
     development system to enable passwordless SSH access to the edge node.
   - **User credentials** - the username and password for the primary user account on the edge node.
   - **Cloud-init customization** - optional, user-defined `cloud-init` configurations for advanced setup requirements.

     For the default non-real-time image, a basic Kubernetes installation is done automatically.

     > **Note:** single node cluster.For deployments requiring desktop virtualization features,
     > refer to the [desktop-virtualization-image-guide](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-microvisor-toolkit-standalone-node/blob/main/andalone-node/docs/user-guide/desktop-virtualization-image-guide.md) in the
     > `user-guide` directory. This document provides reference `cloud-init` configurations that can be
     > tailored to your specific deployment needs.

   - **HugePages configuration** - set when the workloads require HugePages.


### Create the bootable USB drive

1. To create the bootable USB drive, run the script:

   ```bash
   sudo ./bootable-usb-prepare.sh </dev/sdX> usb-bootable-files.tar.gz config-file
   ```

   > **Note:** If you want to add specific configurations, helm charts, or packages to your
   deployment, you can refer to the
   [pre-loading-user-apps guide](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-microvisor-toolkit-standalone-node/blob/main/standalone-node/docs/user-guide/pre-loading-user-apps.md)
   for detailed instructions on customizing your EMT image.

2. Select your Edge Microvisor Toolkit image:

   If you want to use the default non-RT image, [proceed with installation](#3-install-the-toolkit-on-an-edge-device),
   as the `usb-bootable-files.tar.gz` file already includes this image.

   To install [custom build image](#1-build-the-microvisor), or the image with desktop
   virtualization features (DV) you need to copy it manually to the 5th partition of the USB
   drive, thus replacing the default non-RT one. Follow the instructions below:


   1. Mount the 5th partition and remove the default image:

     ```bash
     # Create a test directory for mounting.
     sudo mkdir -p /mnt/test

     # Mount the 5th partition of the USB drive.
     sudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt/test

     # Navigate to the mounted directory.
     cd /mnt/test

     # Remove the older image (backup first if needed).
     sudo rm -f <old-image-file>
     ```

   2. Copy the image to the mounted directory:

      Copy your custom build image from a local directory to 5th partition:

      ```bash
      sudo cp ~/edge-microvisor-toolkit/out/images/edge-image/edge-readonly-3.0.20250717.0840.raw ./
      ```

      If you decided to use the toolkit image with desktop virtualization features,
      you can download it, using the command:

      ```bash

      sudo wget <https://files-rs.edgeorchestration.intel.com/files-edge-orch/repository/microvisor/dv/edge-readonly-dv-3.0.20250717.0840.raw.gz> -O edge-readonly-dv-3.0.20250717.0840.raw.gz
      ```

   3. Unmount the partition:

      ```bash
      cd /
      sudo umount /mnt/test
      ```

## 3. Install the toolkit on an edge device

1. Unplug the attached bootable USB from developer system.

2. Plug the created bootable USB pen drive into the standalone node.

3. Set the BIOS boot manager to boot from the USB drive.

4. Reboot the standalone node to start the installation of Edge Microvisor Toolkit.

5. After the installation, the standalone edge node will automatically reboot into
  the microvisor.

6. On the first boot, `cloud-init` will install the K3s Kubernetes cluster.

### Login to the Edge Node After Installation Completes

Use the Linux login credentials provided while preparing the bootable USB drive.

Make sure to verify the kubernetes cluster creation. If you want to run kubectl commands
from the edge node, you can use the provided ``k`` alias, which is defined in the
`.bashrc` of the user specified during configuration.

```bash
k get pods -A
```

### Set up tools on developer system

Install and configure [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/) and
[helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) tools on the developer system.

> **Note:** The commands can be executed in a `Linux` environment, or any other supporting
  `kubectl` and `helm` by using equivalent commands.

1. Install `kubectl`:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg
   curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.32/deb/Release.key | \
     sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg
   sudo chmod 644 /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg
   echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] \
     https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.32/deb/ /' | \
     sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
   sudo chmod 644 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y kubectl
   ```

2. Copy the kubeconfig file from the edge node:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/.kube
   export EN_IP=<EN_IP>
   scp user@${EN_IP}:/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config
   ```

3. Update the edge node IP (EN_IP) in the kubeconfig file and export the path as KUBECONFIG:

   ```bash
   sed -i "s/127\.0\.0\.1/${EN_IP}/g" ~/.kube/config
   export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
   ```

4. Test the connection:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -A
   ```

5. Install `helm`:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
   chmod 700 get_helm.sh
   ./get_helm.sh
   ```

## 4 Deploy AI solution

Now that you have the edge node ready, you can deploy a sample application from the AI Suites.
Follow the [guide for Smart Parking application](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites/tree/main/metro-ai-suite/smart-parking)
with AI-driven video analytics to optimize parking management.
