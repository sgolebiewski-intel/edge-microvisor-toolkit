# Install Edge Microvisor Toolkit

Edge Microvisor Toolkit can be installed on bare metal, or as a virtual machine. This section
describes in detail how to quickly install and try out Edge Microvisor Toolkit on your system.

## Virtual Machine with Hyper-V

When using Hyper-V you can install the ISO to a virtual hard drive that you create, or
you can attach an existing VHD artifact produced by the build pipeline. See the steps below:

1. From Hyper-V select *Action-> New-> Virtual Machine*.
2. Provide a name for your VM and press *Next*.
3. Select *Generation 1 (VHD)* or *Generation 2 (VHDX)*, then press *Next* .
4. Set the desired amount of memory to allocate, then press *Next* .
5. Select a virtual network switch, then press *Next* .
6. Select *Create a virtual hard disk* and one of two options:
  - Select a location for your VHD(X) and set your desired disk size, then press *Next* .
  - Select *Install an operating system from a bootable image file* and browse to your microvisor ISO.
  - Press *Finish*.

  or

  - Select *Use existing VHD* to proceed with the VHD(X) produced by the build infrastructure.
  - This option does not need the ISO, just press *Next* and *Finish*.

[Gen2/VHDX Only] Fix Boot Options

1. Right click your virtual machine from Hyper-V Manager. Select *Settings...*
2. Select *Security* and disable *Secure Boot*.
3. Select *Firmware* and adjust the boot order so DVD is the first and Hard Drive is second.
4. Select *Apply* to apply all changes.
5. Right click your VM and select *Connect...*. Select *Start*.
6. Follow the Installer prompts to install your image.
7. When installation completes, select *Restart* to reboot the machine. The installation ISO will be automatically ejected.
8. When prompted, sign in to your Edge Microvisor Toolkit using the username and password provisioned through the Installer.

> **Note:**
  When using an existing VHD, the default username/password is root/root.

## Virtual Machine with Oracle Virtual Box

1. Start Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager.
2. Create a new VM and chose a name for the virtual machine.
3. Select the ISO image of Edge Microvisor Toolkit.
4. Under *Operating System*, select *Linux*, sub-type *Fedora (64-bit)*.
5. Configure the number of CPUs and the amount of memory to allocate to the virtual machine.
6. Enable EFI.
7. Create the virtual disk image. If you use a pre-existing disk image (VHD or RAW), convert it to VDI first.

### Converting Image File to VDI

You can convert a VHD or RAW image to the VDI format, which is natively supported by VirtualBox.
Simply, navigate to the installation folder of VirtualBox, e.g. `C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox`
and run the commands below in a terminal to convert:

a VHD disk image:

```bash
VBoxManage clonehd --format VDI <input-vhd-image.vhd> <output-vdi-image.vdi>
```

a RAW disk image:

```bash
VBoxManage convertfromraw <input-vhd-image.img> <output-vdi-image.vdi> --format VDI
```

## Virtual Machine with KVM

On Linux you can install and use Edge Microvisor Toolkit directly with KVM using the graphical `virt-manager` and `virsh`. You can install the OS using the ISO image, or the image file. On KVM it is preferred to use a RAW image, although it does support multiple image formats.

On Ubuntu, install `virt-manager` or `virsh`:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install virt-manager
sudo apt install libvirt-clients
sudo apt install libvirt-daemon-system
sudo usermod -a -G libvirt $(whoami)
```

1. Start `virt-manager`.
2. Create a *New Virtual Machine*.
3. Select *Local installation media* (ISO image) or alternatively *Import existing disk image* and select the RAW disk image.
4. Deselect *Automatically detect from the installation /source* and choose the *Fedora* OS type manually.
5. Configure the number of CPUs and the amount of memory to allocate to the virtual machine.
6. Create the virtual disk image.
7. Create a name for the virtual machine and configure network as desired.

| Image | Support |
| ----- | ------- |
| RAW (.img, .raw)| ✅ Best performance, directly supported|
| QCOW2 (.qcow2)  | ✅ KVM's native format, supports snapshots and compression|
| VHD (.vhd, .vpc)| ⚠️ Limited. Direct use is unreliable, conversion is recommended.|
| VDI (.vdi)      | ❌ No |

## Bare metal with ISO

### Linux

Follow the steps below to create a bootable USB device to install Edge Microvisor Toolkit bare metal on your system.

Ensure you have the microvisor ISO file you want to flash saved on your system. Insert the USB drive and identify it.

```bash
lsblk
```

Compare the output before and after inserting your USB to identify its device name (e.g., /dev/sdb). Flash the ISO Image. Use the `dd` command to write the ISO image. Replace `/path/to/your.iso` with the ISO’s location and `/dev/sdb` with your USB device.

```bash
sudo dd if=/path/to/your.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync
# Warning: Double-check the device name. Using a wrong device can overwrite data.
```

Sync and Eject: Once `dd` has finished, run:

```bash
sudo sync
```

Then, safely remove the USB drive.

### Windows

On Windows, download and install an ISO writer software such as [Rufus](https://rufus.ie).
Make sure you follow the steps below:

1. Plug in the USB device.
2. Launch Rufus and select the USB drive from the dropdown list.
3. Choose the ISO file by clicking *SELECT* under *Boot Selection*.
4. Select *GPT* as the partitioning scheme.
5. Click *START* to begin writing the ISO to the USB device.
6. Eject the USB device when Rufus has completed writing the ISO.

Install the Edge Microvisor Toolkit using the live installer ISO and follow the on-screen configuration instructions. Optionally, you can enable
the option for Full Disc Encryption (FDE).
