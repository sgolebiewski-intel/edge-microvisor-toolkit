# Edge Microvisor Toolkit Developer Node

The Edge Microvisor Toolkit Development Node is a developer version of the Edge
Microvisor Toolkit which is a container host operating system, that comes with
and an ISO installer.

## Overview

The Edge Microvisor Toolkit Development Node is a software package that contains
mutable Edge Microvisor Toolkit in an ISO installer format. Edge Microvisor
Toolkit is a streamlined container operating system that showcases the Intel
silicon optimizations. Built on Azure Linux, it features a Linux Kernel
maintained by Intel, incorporating all the latest kernel and user patches. The
Edge Microvisor Toolkit Development Node has undergone extensive validation
across all Intel platforms such as Xeon®, Intel® Core Ultra™, Intel Core™ and
Intel® Atom®. The Edge Microvisor Toolkit Development Node allows users to
quickly deploy and run their solutions for multiple scenarios like benchmarking
and validation of Edge AI computing workloads. This software package is
available to download as buildable source code from the Open-source repository
or as binary.

The Edge Microvisor Toolkit Development Node supports Native applications and VM
based applications out of the box. Users can customize their Edge Node using the
provided dnf package manager to install container runtimes and Docker tools.
The Edge Microvisor Toolkit Development Node is fully open-Source and royalty
free.

## How It Works

Edge Microvisor Toolkit Development Node is designed to support all Intel®
platforms with the latest Intel® kernel to ensure all features are exposed and
available for application and workloads. The microvisor has been validated on
the following platforms.

|      Atom             |               Core            |      Xeon      |
| ----------------------| ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| Intel® Atom® X Series | 12th Gen Intel® Core™         | 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® SP |
|                       | 13th Gen Intel® Core™         | 3rd Gen Intel® Xeon® SP |
|                       | Intel® Core™ Ultra (Series 1) |                |
